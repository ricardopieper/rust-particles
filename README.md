Rust particles using Piston

Inspired by the current login screen of floatplane.com

## How to run

Go to https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html and install Rust

 - Clone or download this repo
 - Open a command line tool
 - Navigate to the location where the `Cargo.toml` file is located 
 - Run `cargo run --release` on the command line. Running without `--release` will make it super slow.
 
I haven't tested it on Mac or Linux.
